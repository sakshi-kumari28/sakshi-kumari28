# 👋 Hi, I’m Sakshi Kumari

I build **secure, scalable systems** with a strong focus on **cybersecurity, malware detection, and cloud security**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **AI, network defense, and real-world system security**.

I don’t collect certificates for decoration — I build, break, analyze, and improve systems.
